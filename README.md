# CSharpCrashCourse
In this branch I used to study how to read texts and json files.
Also used learned how to serialize and deserialize json for read and work with that information using the Json.Text.Json and NewtonSoft.
and also learned to map json in the case my model is not in the same type of case with the json using automapper and json property mapping
